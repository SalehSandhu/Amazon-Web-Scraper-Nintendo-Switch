# Amazon-Web-Scraper-Nintendo-Switch

## First Web Scraper project.  

## PURPOSE OF PROJECT.  
 The purpose of this project is learn the basics of web scraping. I accomplished this by      
* Scraping the title and price of a Nintendo Switch from Amazon and stored in a CSV file.  
* The CSV file was then automated to check the price everyday.  
* Found a price change within a day.  

## HOW I WOULD MAKE THIS PROJECT BETTER  
* I would add another column indicating whether the price has gotten cheaper, more expensive or remained the same.  
* I would sent the user an email or a text message stating the new price of the item if it got cheaper.
